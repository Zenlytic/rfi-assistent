      "content": "Ex Quanta Inc (d.b.a Zenlytic)\n# Incident Management\nVersion: 0.0\nPolicy Owner: Paul Blankley\nStatus: Implemented\n# Incident Response Policy\nThe Incident Response Team shall respond to all potential or actual security or privacy incidents in accordance with the Incident Response Plan and Incident Response Playbooks.\nThe Incident Response Team shall respond to all incidents according to the Incident Response Playbooks for that category of incident. If no such playbook exists, the Incident Response Team shall follow the model response identified in the Incident Response Plan.\nThe Incident Response Lead shall ensure that all incidents are logged and archived in the Incident Response Log. Once the incident and the response are documented, the Incident Response Team shall mark the incident as closed. This will happen in Zenlytic’s Product Management Tool.\n# Incident Response Training and Testing Policy\nIn order to ensure that Zenlytic is prepared to respond to all potential and actual security and privacy incidents, the Incident Response Team shall be trained on Zenlytic's incident response policies and plan, and shall perform incident response exercises.\nThe Incident Response Team shall review the following as part of training:\n• the Incident Response Plan\n• the Incident Response Playbooks\n• the documentation logged from all incidents since the last training\n## Tabletop Exercises\nTabletop exercises are “discussion-based exercises where personnel meet in a classroom setting or in breakout groups to discuss their roles during an emergency and their responses to a particular emergency situation. A facilitator presents a scenario and asks the exercise participants questions related to the scenario, which initiates a discussion among the participants of roles, responsibilities, coordination, and decision-making. A tabletop exercise is discussion-based only and does not involve deploying equipment or other resources.”\nThe objective of a tabletop exercise is to determine if members of the Incident Response Team can realistically walk through their critical functions during a mock incident.\nTo perform a tabletop exercise, the Incident Response Team shall choose at least one incident that Zenlytic will likely face in the next twelve months.\nThe Incident Response Team shall create a playbook for the chosen incident. At a minimum, this shall include the following information for each chosen incident:\n• the date the playbook was created;\n• the individual or team responsible for the playbook (the Owner);\n• the internal and external resources needed to follow the playbook in a real incident;\n• Phase 1: How the Incident Response Team should identify occurrence of the incident; whom the Incident Response Team should notify of the incident; and how the Incident Response Team should assess the incident;\n• Phase 2: How the Incident Response Team should contain and eradicate the incident;\n• Phase 3: The post-incident activity that the Incident Response Team should take, including reporting the incident if necessary, and performing after-action reviews.\nThe Incident Response Team may revisit and update existing playbooks as part of tabletop testing.\nIn addition to scheduled tabletop exercises, at least annually, the Incident Response Lead will simulate the occurrence of an incident and ensure that the Incident Response Team follows the relevant playbooks. The test incident shall be logged in the Incident Response Log.\n# Concept of Operations for Incident Response\nZenlytic shall use a phased approach for the investigation and resolution of privacy and security incidents.\n## Incident Response Planning\nZenlytic shall plan its response to security and privacy incidents by developing this Incident Response Plan, developing the Incident Response Playbooks (as described in the Incident Response Training and Testing Policy), and applying security controls for critical information systems.\n### Business Impact Analysis\nThe Incident Response Team shall prioritize its responses to multiple incidents based on:\n• the criticality of the affected assets; and\n• the current or potential adverse effect.\n### Communications\nDuring the incident response process, the Incident Response Team shall communicate via the following methods/tools:\n• Slack\n• Video chat\n• Phone\n• Email (if necessary)\n## Incident Response Phases\n### Phase 1: Identification and Notification\nActivation Criteria\nThe identification phase is focused on detecting whether an actual security or privacy incident took place. In this phase, the responder shall attempt to gain an understanding of the nature of the incident and to make a determination whether the incident is not a false positive.\nNotification Procedures\nIf the event is not a false positive, or the responder is unable to make a determination, the responder shall notify other workforce members according to the playbook for that type of incident. If no individual is identified, the workforce member shall notify the Security Officer or the Incident Response Lead.\nAssessment\nIncidents and response efforts, shall be documented with:\n• A ticket in Linear (or other issue tracking tool).\n• (If applicable to the incident) A Postmortem (Root Cause Analysis) report\nThe Incident Response Team shall assess the scope and nature of the incident by reviewing the following:\n• Incident name\n• Incident type (e.g., availability, denial of service, unauthorized access, etc)\n• An executive summary of the incident\n• Severity level\n• Status of the incident\n• A full timeline of actions taken by all members of the Incident Response Team (this is updated through all phases of the incident)\n### Phase 2: Containment and Eradication\nThe Incident Response Team shall contain and eradicate the incident.\nPlaybooks should clearly identify the steps that should be taken to limit and mitigate the effects of the compromise.\n### Phase 3: Post-Incident Activity\nReporting\nAs applicable, the Security Officer shall report the incident to necessary parties to fulfill contractual, statutory, or other legal requirements and best practices.\nReview and Prevention\nAfter eradication and recovery of each incident, the Incident Response Team shall review the incident as well as Zenlytic’s handling of the incident. This should be fully documented in a Postmortem (Root Cause Analysis) report, along with any action items designed to mitigate or prevent such incidents in the future.",

However, they also present a risk to the security and privacy of our information, systems, and premises. Hence, a systematic and comprehensive offboarding process is necessary to mitigate these risks and ensure a smooth transition. This policy sets forth our standard procedures for the termination and offboarding of employees and contractors.\n## Objective\nThe objective of this policy is to define the procedures to be followed when an employee or contractor separates from the company, ensuring that the company's assets, data, and systems are secure and that the separation is handled in an organized, respectful, and professional manner.\n## Scope\nThis policy applies to all Zenlytic employees and contractors. All managers, supervisors, and team leaders are responsible for ensuring the compliance of their teams with this policy.\n## Policy\n- Notification of Separation: As soon as the decision to terminate an employment or contractor relationship has been made, the Human Resources Team must be notified. Contractor terminations must also be coordinated with the Human Resources Team if the contract ends early.\n- Offboarding Process: The Human Resources Team is responsible for initiating and overseeing the offboarding process at or before the separation date. This includes ensuring that the departing employee or contractor returns all Zenlytic-owned physical assets.\n- Revoking Access: The Human Resources Team or the separating employee’s manager is responsible for timely revoking the separating employee's access to Zenlytic's information, premises, and systems. Access to systems containing Sensitive/Regulated Information must be revoked within 24 hours of notice of the employee or contractor's departure.\n- Shared Credentials: The Human Resources Team shall collaborate with the Security Team to rotate shared credentials that the separating employee or contractor had access to.\n- Logging Actions: All actions related to access revocation must be logged in the Security Management Tasks.\n- Asset Return and Transfer: All Zenlytic-owned physical assets in the possession of the departing employee or contractor must be returned at termination. If the manager or department requests access to the asset(s), proper asset transfer procedures must be followed.\n- Exit Interview: The Human Resources Team or the separating employee's manager shall conduct an exit interview with the separating employee or contractor. The separating individual should be reminded of their ongoing security obligations as outlined in their employment or contractor agreement. The occurrence of this interview must be logged.\n## Enforcement\nFailure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment for existing employees. Legal action may be taken where necessary.\n## Return of Assets \nEmployees who are terminated will be have access revoked to all web-based systems and will return the following physical items\n• Laptop\n## Revision History\nThis policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually or whenever significant changes occur to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.",

      "content": "Ex Quanta Inc (d.b.a Zenlytic)\n## Change Management Policy and Procedures\nVersion: 1.0\nPolicy Owner: Paul Blankley\nStatus: Implemented\n## Introduction\nThe Change Management Plan was created for the Zenlytic in order to set expectations on how the approach to changes will be managed, what defines a change, the purpose and role of the change control board, and the overall change management process. All stakeholders will be expected to submit or request changes to Zenlytic in accordance with this Change Management Plan and all requests and submissions will follow the process detailed herein.\n## Change Management Approach\nThe Change Management approach for Zenlytic will ensure that all proposed changes are defined, reviewed, and agreed upon so they can be properly implemented and communicated to all stakeholders. This approach will also ensure that only changes within the scope of this project are approved and implemented.\nThe Change Management approach is not to be confused with the Change Management Process which will be detailed later in this plan. The Change Management approach consists of three areas:\n• Ensure changes are within scope and beneficial to the project\n• Determine how the change will be implemented\n• Manage the change as it is implemented\nThe Change Management process has been designed to make sure this approach is followed for all changes. By using this approach methodology, the Zenlytic Team will prevent unnecessary change from occurring and focus its resources only on beneficial changes within the project scope.\n## Definitions of Change\nThere are several types of changes which may be requested and considered for Zenlytic. Depending on the extent and type of proposed changes, changes project documentation and the communication of these changes will be required to include any approved changes into the project plan and ensure all stakeholders are notified. Types of changes include:\n• Scheduling Changes: changes which will impact the approved project schedule. These changes may require fast tracking, crashing, or re-baselining the schedule depending on the significance of the impact.\n• Budget Changes: changes which will impact the approved project budget. These changes may require requesting additional funding, releasing funding which would no longer be required, or adding to project or management reserves. May require changes to the cost baseline.\n• Scope Changes: changes which are necessary and impact the project’s scope which may be the result of unforeseen requirements which were not initially planned for. These changes may also impact budget and schedule. These changes may require revision to tickets, project scope statement, and other project documentation as necessary.\nThe project manager must ensure that any approved changes are communicated to the project stakeholders. Additionally, as changes are approved, the project manager must ensure that the changes are captured in the project documentation where necessary. These document updates must then be communicated to the project team and stakeholders as well.\n## Change Control Process\nThe Change Control Process for Zenlytic will follow the organizational standard change process for all projects. The project manager has overall responsibility for executing the change management process for each change request.\n- Identify the need for a change (Stakeholders) – Change requestor will submit a modification request to the ticket to modify in the project management tool to the owner of the ticket.\n- Log change in the change request register (Project Manager) – The project manager will keep a log of all submitted change requests throughout the project’s lifecycle. This will be done in the project management tool.\n- Evaluate the change (Project Manager, Team, Requestor) – The project manager will conduct a preliminary analysis on the impact of the change to risk, cost, schedule, and scope and seek clarification from team members and the change requestor.\n- Obtain Decision on change request – The project manager will discuss the proposed change and decide whether or not it will be approved based on all submitted information.\n- Implement change (Project Manager) – If a change is approved by the project manager, he or she will update the ticket and documentation as necessary.",

      "parent": "Employee Handbook",
      "content": "Ex Quanta Inc (d.b.a Zenlytic)\n## Vendor Management Policy\nVersion: 0.0\nPolicy Owner: Paul Blankley\nStatus: Implemented\n# Purpose and Scope\n• This policy defines the rules for relationships with the organization’s Information Technology (IT) vendors and partners.\n• This policy applies to all IT vendors and partners who have the ability to impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the organization’s technology and sensitive information, or who are within the scope of the organization’s information security program.\n• This policy applies to all employees and contractors that are responsible for the management and oversight of IT vendors and partners of the organization.\n• This policy ensures customers are notified in the event a new third-party subprocessor is added that processes customer data.\nIt is the duty of CTO and CISO to ensure:\n• Each vendor relationship supports the entity’s strategic plan and meets the requirements and policies;\n• The entity has sufficient expertise to oversee and manage the relationship;\n• The entity has evaluated prospective providers based on the scope and criticality of the outsourced services;\n• The risks associated with the use of vendors for the entity’s critical operations are fully understood; and\n• An appropriate oversight program is in place to monitor each vendor's risk management controls, financial condition and contractual performance.\nThe overall security of the organization is highly dependent on the security of its contractual relationships with its IT vendors. This policy defines requirements for effective management and oversight of such vendors from an information security perspective. The policy prescribes minimum standards a vendor must meet from an information security standpoint, including security clauses, risk assessments, service level agreements, and incident management.\n# Rationale\nThe entity acquires services from third‐party suppliers, vendors, consultants and/or contractors (the \"Vendor” or “Vendors\") which involve risks similar to those that arise when these functions are performed internally by the entity. These include such risks as threats to the availability of systems used to support these transactions along with the accuracy, completeness, integrity, security, and privacy of protected information and compliance with applicable regulations.\nUnder contractual arrangements, risk management procedures commonly used by the entity to address these risks, are generally under the control of the vendor, rather than the entity. However, the entity continues to bear certain associated risks of financial loss, reputation damage, or other adverse consequences from actions of the vendor or the failure of the vendor to adequately manage risk.\nConsequently, it is imperative for the entity to evaluate the ability of existing and prospective vendors to fulfill their contractual obligations and to prepare formal analyses of risks associated with obtaining services from, or outsourcing processing to, third parties.\n## Responsibility/Ownership\nThe CTO and CISO shall be the owners of the Vendor Management Policy with oversight by the Security Steering Committee.\n# Classifications of Vendor Criticality\nDuring the vendor selection process, the CTO and CISO will assess the risks associated with vendor inadequacy (e.g. data confidentiality, Service Level Agreements, privacy assurances, user support, etc.). Prior to determining the risk, the entity will consider the criticality of the services and apply a ranking according to the criteria below.\n• High (3) ‐ Services in this category include those considered \"critical\" to the entity’s operations. The entity would not be able to operate at adequate capacity without the availability of such services or deliver minimally acceptable levels of customer service.\n• Medium (2) ‐ Services in this category include those considered of importance to the entity’s operations.\n• Low (1) ‐ Services in this category include those considered incidental to the entity’s operations or for whom the entity would have an acceptable alternate vendor readily available or an alternative means to process.\n# Risk Management\nRisk management is the process of identifying, measuring, monitoring and managing risk. Risk exists whether the entity performs work internally or outsources work.\nWhen a new procurement is initiated for a new vendor or for an existing vendor but for a new service, the procurement team requests the business owner to fill out an overview form prior to processing the purchase order. The business owner provides as much information about the vendor as available to aid in initiating the risk assessment. At a minimum, the information requested in the vendor overview form is required.\nThe CTO and CISO with oversight by the Security Steering Committee, will consider some or all of the following factors in evaluating the quantity of risk at the inception of an outsourcing decision. The degree to which these factors will be considered will depend on the criticality rating of the function provided by the vendor.\n• Sensitivity of data accessed, protected or controlled by the vendor\n• Volume of transactions\n• Criticality to the business\n• Strength of financial condition\n• Turnover of management and employees\n• Ability to maintain business continuity\n• Ability to provide accurate, relevant, and timely information systems\n• Experience with the function outsourced\n• Reliance on subcontractors\n• Location, especially if foreign based\n• Redundancy and reliability of communication lines\n• Location (processing and data storage)\n• Dependence on third parties\n• Reliability\n• Security\n• Scalability to accommodate future growth\n# Agreements\nWhen agreements or contracts are required between the entity and a vendor, the contract will be developed in consultation with the Legal Team.\n# Vendor Contract Monitoring\nThe CTO and CISO will ensure vendors provide the goods and/or services in accordance with the vendor contract. Monitoring of contract performance will include but not be limited to review of the data confidentiality, Service Level Agreements, privacy assurances, user support. The program shall monitor the vendor environment including its security controls, financial strength and the impact of any external events. The amount of review and documentation needed to support vendor contract management will vary depending on the criticality and complexity of the system, process or service being outsourced. \nTo increase monitoring effectiveness, the CTO and CISO shall periodically, but at least annually, rank vendor relationships according to risk to determine which vendors require closer monitoring. The CTO and CISO with oversight by the Security Steering Committee, shall base the rankings on the residual risk of the relationship after analyzing the quantity of risk relative to the controls over those risks. Relationships with higher risk ratings should receive more frequent and stringent monitoring for due diligence, performance (financial and or operational) and independent control validation reviews.",

Purpose and Scope\nThe purpose of this Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is to ensure that our Business Intelligence (BI) platform can continue to operate during and after a disruptive event. This plan outlines the steps for preparedness, response, and recovery, ensuring minimal disruption to critical BI services such as data processing, reporting, and analytics. It applies to all systems, personnel, and processes supporting the platform.\n### 2. Objectives\n• Maintain availability of critical BI services with minimal downtime.\n• Protect sensitive data and ensure data integrity.\n• Provide clear roles, responsibilities, and actions for team members in the event of a disruption.\n• Ensure a swift recovery of services to meet Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO).\n### 3. Risk Assessment and Business Impact Analysis (BIA)\nA detailed risk assessment and BIA have been conducted to identify potential risks and their impacts on the BI platform. Key risks include, but are not limited to:\n• Software issues or bugs\n• Vendor failures\n• Network outages\n• Cybersecurity attacks (DDoS, etc.)\nRisks are fully outlined in the CC1.2.2 Risk Assessment document.\nImpact on Business Operations: Downtime of the BI platform could result in lost business insights, reduced operational efficiency, and missed business opportunities.\n### 4. Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)\n• Recovery Time Objectives (RTO): The BI platform must be restored within 4 hours of a disruption for critical services.\n• Recovery Point Objectives (RPO): Data loss must not exceed 15 minutes in the event of a disruption.\n### 5. Key Components of the BI Platform\n• Cloud infrastructure: Hosted primarily on Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n• Data storage: All data is backed up using native AWS RDS features. This policy is documented in our CC7.2.2 Database Backup Policy \n### 6. Business Continuity Strategies\n6.1 High Availability and Redundancy\n• Database Failover: RDS instances for databases have multi-AZ replication enabled to automatically failover in the event of failure.\n• Auto-scaling: AWS ECS is configured for auto-scaling, ensuring that enough resources are available during peak loads or disruptions.\n6.2 Backup and Recovery\n• Data Backups: Automated backups are taken of all critical data using AWS RDS, with replication to multiple AWS regions. Backup frequency is every 5 minutes to meet the RPO\n6.3 Incident Response Plan\n• Incident Detection: 24/7 monitoring through AWS CloudWatch and GuardDuty. Alerts are configured for anomalies such as unusual traffic, latency, or failed services.\n• Incident Escalation: Incidents are escalated based on severity. \n• Response Procedures: In the event of a disruption:\n### 7. Communication Plan\nIn the event of a disruption, the following communication steps will be followed:\n• Internal Communication: Incident response team is immediately notified via Slack and email. Regular updates on the status of the disruption and recovery process will be provided.\n• Customer Communication: In case of significant outages that invoke the BCP (exceeding 4 hours or lost customer data), affected customers will be notified via email within 24 hours of the event, with updates provided as available.\n### 8. Testing and Maintenance\n• Testing Schedule: The Business Continuity Plan will be tested annually to ensure that all procedures are up-to-date and effective. Testing will include failover simulations, backup restoration, and incident response drills.\n• Plan Review: The BCP will be reviewed quarterly, or after a significant incident, to incorporate lessons learned, changes in infrastructure, or updates in business operations.\n• Training: All relevant personnel will undergo BCP training annually, covering roles, responsibilities, and response procedures.\n### 9. Roles and Responsibilities\n• Incident Commander: Coordinates the overall incident response, communication, and recovery efforts.\n• DevOps Team: Responsible for infrastructure restoration, failover, and ensuring system availability.\n• Database Administrators: Restore database services and ensure data integrity post-recovery.\n• Communications Lead: Responsible for internal and external communication during an incident.\n### 10. Continuous Improvement\nAfter each incident or disruption, a post-incident review will be conducted to:\n• Analyze the root cause of the disruption.\n• Evaluate the effectiveness of the BCP response.\n• Identify areas for improvement and update the BCP accordingly.\n## 11. Compliance\nAll staff are required to comply with this Business Continuity Plan. Non-compliance may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.",

Zenlytic will cover all mandatory employer fees as stipulated by law.\nWhile satisfying all the aforementioned requirements is necessary, it doesn't guarantee green card sponsorship, as the final decision rests at Zenlytic's discretion. We may consider exceptions to this policy in scenarios where it is crucial to avert potential disruption to our business, assure the continuity of the employee's work authorization, or comply with legal mandates. When we initiate your green card sponsorship, you will liaise directly with our immigration counsel. In order to facilitate a seamless process, we expect you to provide precise and comprehensive information and documents in a timely fashion.\nThis policy doesn't restrict you from pursuing a green card via routes that don't need Zenlytic's sponsorship. For instance, you can apply for a green card through a family relationship with a U.S. citizen or permanent resident or by self-petitioning. Should you have any questions regarding this policy, please reach out to our Legal or People Team (currently, 7/9/2023, Ryan & Paul).\n## Reimbursement Agreement",

Zenlytic also uses advanced semantic data modeling to make it easier for end-users to explore data.\nZenlytic’s core services provide the following capabilities:\n• Data ingestion through secure Data Warehouse connections \n• Automated data cleaning and normalization\n• Natural language data summaries and insights generated from large language models\n• Data visualization tools for exploring insights\n• Data access controls and security\nZenlytic’s services are designed to provide automated, scalable data analysis to clients. The natural language insights generated by Zenlytic’s large language models make data more accessible to clients.\n## Principal Service Commitments and System Requirements\nZenlytic designs its methodologies and practices in relation to its business intelligence services to achieve its objectives for these services. The objectives are shaped by the service commitments that Zenlytic makes to its clients, the regulatory landscape governing the provision of business intelligence services, and the financial, operational, and compliance benchmarks that Zenlytic has put in place. Zenlytic's business intelligence services comply with various data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as well as local data protection laws in the regions where Zenlytic operates.\nService commitments regarding security to user entities are thoroughly documented and communicated through Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and other client agreements, as well as in the description of the service offering available online. These security commitments are standardized and encompass, but are not restricted to, the following elements:\n• Security principles ingrained within the essential designs of the business intelligence tool that allow users to access information pertinent to their role in the system, while preventing them from accessing data not required for their function.\n• Utilization of encryption technologies to safeguard client data, both in transit and at rest.\nZenlytic sets up operational requirements that help fulfill security commitments, applicable laws and regulations, and other system requirements. These requirements are expressed in Zenlytic's system policies and procedures, system design documentation, and contracts with clients. Information security policies outline a company-wide approach to the protection of systems and data. This includes policies around how the service is designed and developed, how the system is operated, how internal business systems and networks are managed, and how employees are recruited and trained. In addition to these policies, standard operating procedures have been documented to provide guidance on executing specific manual and automated processes vital for the operation and development of the business intelligence tool.\n## Components of the System Used to Provide the Services\n### Infrastructure\nZenlytic uses AWS as its cloud provider. It runs Docker containers on the AWS ECS service, uses AWS RDS for its database, AWS Parameter Store for environment variables, and leverages AWS S3 for storing files. Zenlytic also uses AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting and AWS Lambda for serverless computing. Zenlytic’s comprehensive architecture diagram is below: \n### Software\nZenlytic's back end is written in Python, and its front end is built with React. It also uses several other technologies, including Docker for containerization and AWS services for cloud computing and storage.\nZenlytic's software infrastructure is composed of a Python Flask backend and a React frontend, developed and maintained by Zenlytic's in-house software engineering team. This software stack is deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and is designed to provide service for Zenlytic's clientele, which includes corporations, governments, and other organizations (user entities) in need of efficient business intelligence solutions. Zenlytic's software is proprietary and not sold on the open market.\nZenlytic's system processes information in real-time. The information is immediately stored in the database and is accessible for a variety of operational uses, including data analysis, report generation, and tracking of user interactions.\nThe Zenlytic interface is a multiuser, web-based application that facilitates the flow of information between Zenlytic and its corporate clients. This interface allows clients to input and retrieve specific information about their data analysis needs and provides performance reports to help manage their usage of Zenlytic's services. To access the site, corporations must register and provide certain required information, such as roles and permissions desired and connection information for their data warehouse.\nThe Zenlytic interface is provided as a service to Zenlytic's clients. This interface allows them to monitor basic statistics of their usage and resolve simple queries. Summary reports of data volume, queries, and utilization are available in addition to detailed reports for individual data analyses, single queries, and user activity.\n### Data\nData, as defined by Zenlytic, consists of the following:\n• Production Database: This is the central data storage for Zenlytic, containing all the data points collected from various sources and used for processing. It includes structured and unstructured data, user interactions, and permissions.\n• Metric Definitions: These are definitions of measurements that Zenlytic uses to analyze performance or gauge the value delivered by the tool. Metrics could include conversion definitions, data processing times, data accuracy scores, and system performance indicators. These are stored in a git repo.\n• Output Reports: These are the results generated from Zenlytic's data processing and analysis. It includes data analysis reports, visualizations, and other forms of output that are provided to the user.\n• System Files: These include files that are necessary for the system's operation, such as configuration files, system logs, and error logs. These are stored in AWS S3 and Parameter Store.\n• Error Logs: These logs contain records of any errors or issues that occur during the operation of Zenlytic's system. They are used to troubleshoot problems and improve system performance. These are stored securely in AWS Cloudwatch and Sentry.\nAll data processing initiates with the receipt of a data analysis or report generation request from users or client entities. After the data processing is completed, feedback and usage information is logged. Reports generated by Zenlytic are made available securely via electronic PDF, comma-delimited value file exports, or directly from the various web interfaces, depending on the user's role and privileges.\n### People\nZenlytic has 11 employees and those staff are in the following areas:\n• Customer Success\n• Sales\n• Marketing\n• Engineering\n• Design\n### Processes and Procedures\nZenlytic's management has formulated and disseminated procedures to limit logical access to its business intelligence platform. These procedures are reviewed and updated annually under the authorization of senior management. The procedures cover the following key security life cycle areas:\n• Data Classification: This involves organizing data based on its level of sensitivity, value, and criticality. It covers data at rest (stored data), in motion (data being transferred), and output (resultant data).\n• Information Categorization: This refers to the sorting and labeling of data based on factors such as its origin, nature, and intended use.\n• Business Impact Assessment: This involves evaluating the potential effects on business operations and objectives that might result from different security strategies.\n• Security Controls Selection and Implementation: This includes the process of choosing, documenting, and deploying appropriate security measures to safeguard data and systems.\n• Security Control Self-Assessments: Zenlytic conducts annual self-assessments to evaluate the effectiveness of its security controls.\n• Access Management: This involves authorizing, modifying, and terminating access to the information system, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data and systems.\n• Security Monitoring: This includes regular surveillance of security controls to detect any anomalies or potential breaches.\n• Role-based Access Control: This involves managing user access and privileges based on their roles within the organization.\n• Security System Maintenance: This includes the upkeep and support of the security system, as well as the provision for necessary backup and offline storage.\n• Incident Response: Zenlytic has procedures in place for responding to security incidents promptly and effectively.\n• Restricted Access Maintenance: Zenlytic maintains restricted access to system configurations, super user functionality, master passwords, powerful utilities, and security devices such as firewalls to ensure only authorized personnel have access to these sensitive aspects of the system.\n## Relevant Aspects of the Control Environment, Risk Assessment Process, Information and Communication, and Monitoring\n### Control Environment\nManagement Philosophy\nZenlytic's control environment mirrors the management's philosophy highlighting the significance of securing data and information related to business intelligence and analytics. The Security Steering Committee of Zenlytic meets quarterly and reports to the board annually. This committee, guided by the Zenlytic board, supervises the company's security activities. The members of this committee represent each business line and are entrusted with setting up comprehensive security policies and procedures for Zenlytic. Security's importance is underscored within Zenlytic through the formulation and communication of these policies and procedures, backed by investment in resources and personnel to execute the policies. Zenlytic, in designing its controls, considers their relevance to meet pertinent trust criteria.\nSecurity Management\nZenlytic boasts a dedicated information security committee, which includes a security officer. They are responsible for overseeing information security across the organization. As members of the Security Steering Committee, they maintain security credentials and are obliged to annually review the information security policies. Their responsibilities encompass the development, maintenance, and enforcement of Zenlytic's information security policies. The information security policy is reviewed annually by the security officer, CTO, and CEO, and it is endorsed by the Security Steering Committee.\nAs the information security team safeguards security, they monitor known incidents and patches along with the results from recent vulnerability assessments. They address necessary modifications to policies and procedures, which can include a reclassification of data, a reassessment of risk, modifications in incident response plans, and a verification of responsibilities for authorizing and monitoring accesses.\nDuring annual security training and awareness programs, the management ensures the latest security policies are communicated, and the written job descriptions for security management are clarified.\nMoreover, the management is responsible for ensuring that business associate agreements are current for third parties and for revising the annual IT risk assessment.\nSecurity Policies\nZenlytic has put the following security policies and related processes into place:\n• Data classification and business impact assessment\n• Selection, documentation, and implementation of security controls\n• Assessment of security controls\n• User access authorization and provisioning\n• Revocation of user access\n• Monitoring of security controls\n• Security management\nZenlytic has implemented an application to support these policies and enhance the workflow and approval process. This application enables tracking of:\n• Changes to data classification\n• Additions, modifications, or deletions of users\n• Changes to authority levels in access approvals\n• Tests of new security components before installation\n• Reviews of significant security monitoring events.\nChange Management\nZenlytic's Change Management Plan establishes the approach to managing changes, defining a change, the function of the change control board, and the overall change management process. The Change Management approach ensures that all proposed changes are defined, reviewed, agreed upon, and appropriately implemented, focusing only on beneficial changes within the project scope. Changes may involve scheduling, budget, or scope, each of which requires different procedures and potential adjustments to project plans and communication strategies. The change control process follows the organization's standard process, with the project manager being responsible for executing the change management process for each change request. This process involves identifying the need for a change, logging the change, evaluating it, making a decision based on the submitted information, and implementing the change if approved.\nData Security and Backups\nZenlytic's data security measures are focused on consistent database backups (every 5 minutes) and the constant use of encryption to protect key data assets. It should be noted that Zenlytic operates on Amazon Web Services, a platform known for its robust security features.\nRisk Assessment\nZenlytic's Risk Assessment outlines the processes for maintaining an up-to-date list of risks, creating or updating a risk register, and selecting risk treatments. The policy mandates the Security Team to regularly review information sources related to information security threats and risks, including AWS, OpenAI, Anthropic, Algolia, and Github.\nThe Security Officer is responsible for updating the risk register based on threats that currently affect Zenlytic. This includes risks arising from changes in Zenlytic's operational security, external environment, business model, leadership, systems and technology, as well as vendors and partners.\nThe risk update process involves four steps: updating the Risk Management Framework, determining the risk tolerance curve, grading the previous assessment, and conducting a new risk assessment. The risk tolerance curve is defined by estimating the dollar amounts that Zenlytic can afford to lose at different certainty levels.\nOnce the risk assessment results are evaluated, the Security Officer selects treatment actions for each risk. Treatment options include accepting the risk, mitigating it, avoiding it, transferring it, or sharing it. For risks that are to be mitigated, the Security Officer ensures the implementation of a security control that will reduce the likelihood of the risk.\nThe Risk Management Framework includes goals for the risk assessment, a threat model detailing which threats Zenlytic is subject to, and a risk model for assessing risk. Zenlytic's threat model includes a number of threat sources, while the risk model identifies risk tolerance and compares it to expected losses due to threats faced.\nZenlytic's risk acceptance criteria are estimated prior to each risk assessment, and risks are framed in terms of risk statements that identify threat events, the likelihood of occurrence, and intervals that estimate the likely impact caused by the threat events.",

      "content": "Zoë operates with an Agentic architecture. This means that at each step of the question-answering process, the LLM chooses between calling a tool in its set of tools or responding directly to the user. \nIf the LLM chooses to call a tool, Zenlytic will run the tool and show the results to the LLM. The LLM will then make a decision on whether it wants to call another tool or respond directly to the user. This process continues until the LLM responds directly to the user.\nA high-level diagram of this workflow looks like this:\n## Question Answering Process\nTo be more specific on the set of tools that Zoë uses and when she uses them, let’s look at a more complicated question flow that involves a wider range of tools used. \n- User asks a question “Can you show me gross revenue by product YTD and tell me which product had the highest growth from last YTD to this YTD?”\n- Zoë passes that question to the LLM which determines it wants to use the search fields tool. It queries the search fields tool with the search terms “gross revenue”, “ytd”, “product”.\n- Zoë executes the tool itself, and returns matching fields like order_lines.total_gross_revenue, order_lines.order_date, and products.product_title, along with their additional metadata and SQL definitions.\n- Zoë structures the SQL she wants to use from the metadata into a tool call to the LLM, and the LLM determines that it wants to use the run a query tool. It calls the run a query tool with SQL referencing the field definitions that it saw in the search fields tool response.\n- Zoë compiles the arguments the LLM passes into SQL using the Clarity Engine, and executes that SQL query on the customer’s warehouse.\n- Zoë passes the result of the tool call (the data from the query run on the warehouse) to the LLM and the LLM determines that it wants to use the code interpreter tool to calculate the percentage change from last YTD  to this YTD. The LLM writes the code it wants to execute on top of the query results it sees.\n- Zoë executes the code it received as part of the tool call for code interpreter in an isolated sandbox environment. \n- Zoë passes the result of the code interpreter execution to the LLM, and the LLM determines it wants to respond to the user directly and end the iteration process. The LLM responds with text summarizing the results of the conversation thus far.\n- Zoë passes that summarization to the user (including the previously used tool calls and results), answering their question. \nAnother helpful visual, which doesn’t contain all LLM calls made in the process outlined above, but shows all the unique services used, and how they fit together:",

      "title": "FAQ - Zenlytic Security",
      "parent": "Security Homepage",
      "content": "### How do you connect to the data warehouse?\n• Zenlytic uses database credentials to connect to and run SQL queries on your data warehouse. Zenlytic does NOT index any whole tables or copy data from your system to ours. We create a SQL query on the fly based on metadata stored in git and connected to Zenlytic and run that query on your data warehouse.\n### Do you cache my data?\n• We do. We use Redis to cache query results, but never the underlying tables in the warehouse. For example, if you ask for revenue daily, we will run a query to produce the data needed to show you that plot and cache the data that shows up on the plot so the next time that question is asked, it hits the cache instead of running a duplicative query on your warehouse. Note: you can configure the cache expiry time or disable the cache entirely if you wish. \n### How do you initialize the semantic layer?\n• We use solely metadata from information_schema in your warehouse to create the semantic layer. The semantic layer itself is a collection of yaml files that are stored in a git repo, which is connected to Zenlytic via an SSH key pair \n• One other (optional) feature we offer is the ability to tag a field as searchable which tells our system to index the unique values in that column. This is useful for columns like status which contain values like Fulfilled or Cancelled, so Zoë can answer questions like “how many cancelled orders did we have last week?” Only fields with searchable: true tagged explicitly will be indexed (and only the unique values of the column will be indexed).\n### How does the data flow from question to Zoë to answer?\n- We use your information_schema tables to get the metadata to create the semantic layer. You then tag which fields you want us to index, and add any nuance in how to use which fields\n- We pass that metadata to Zoe who will use it to make the decision on which fields to use in which combinations to best answer your question. That selection will be compiled into a SQL query, which we will run on your data warehouse.\n- We will take that result, pick a default plot, and show the result to Zoe for summarization and synthesis.\n- Results can then be added to dashboards and scheduled for delivery, or shared between users (who both have permissions to access the underlying data)\n### What data do you pull from our system to run the solution in Zenlytic SaaS? Do you pull the metadata and view/table definitions/relationships ONLY to create the semantic layer inside of Zenlytic, and DO NOT PULL ANY datasets housed inside of our Snowflake tables into your environment?\n- To create the semantic layer we use just metadata from information_schema tables, and we never, under any circumstances, pull raw tables from your warehouse and replicate them in our system. We create SQL queries on the fly as indicated by selections in the UI either by users or by Zoë and run those queries on your warehouse.\n- We also offer the (optional) ability to tag fields like a “status” or “type” so we index the unique values of those columns and show them to Zoë to improve her ability to answer questions\n- If its only the metadata and relationships being pulled, then when the prompts are fired, LLMs will evaluate the prompts, and access the semantic layer to produce the results, but at this time, during runtime, don’t you pull our data or do you push all the data processing inside snowflake to retrieve only the results and then pass it onto the presentation layer?\n### Can you clarify the orchestration of the prompt to response in detail to essentially clarify how our data is used and how our core business data can be protected at rest and in transit (if being pulled).\n- We use your information_schema tables to get the metadata to create the semantic layer. You then tag which fields you want us to index, and add any nuance in how to use which fields\n- We pass that metadata to Zoe who will use it to make the decision on which fields to use in which combinations to best answer your question. That selection will be compiled into a SQL query, which we will run on your data warehouse.\n- We will take that result, pick a default plot, and show the result to Zoe for summarization and synthesis.\n- Results can then be added to dashboards and scheduled for delivery, or shared between users (who both have permissions to access the underlying data)\n## Is your platform running on AWS? Azure? Any others?\n• We run primarily on AWS, but we run one tangential service on Azure.\n## What region is the platform running in within the respective cloud provider?\n• All cloud providers run in US East 1, except for our EU infra, which is wholly separate and runs in EU Central 1\n## Do you use any AI “watermarks” i.e. something that indicates that AI is being used and responses may be inaccurate/need to be fact checked?\n• No\n## Do you have…\n• An Incident Response policy - Yes\n• A Disaster Recovery policy - Yes\n• Routine tests for disaster recovery - Yes\n• An Employee Handbook - Yes\n• An Information Security policy - Yes\n• A Change Management policy - Yes\n• A Roles & Responsibilities policy - Yes\n• Regular information security trainings - Yes\n## What are the different user roles / permission sets?\n• Intercom doc",

This data analyst would have access to all of the internal enterprise data that the business user has access to; it could make sense of the data, answer questions about the data, and create visuals, documents, and presentations for the user. It would go beyond just reporting about internal data to creating predictions and recommendations. Further, the analyst would be capable of deep analysis and could derive root causes of events and recommend preventive actions. In short, it would be an aide capable of performing at the highest levels of intelligence.\nThe purpose of this document is to outline the technical vision for the major components of the core backend, in support of  Zenlytic’s product vision.\n### Assumptions\nTo start with, we assume that our customers are enterprises and not consumers. Different enterprises have different infrastructures, and we assume that they will need integrations with some combinations of the following systems:\n- Datastores - for starters, SQL datastores, but eventually other data stores\n- User management systems, such as directory providers\n- Cloud providers - for now AWS but eventually Azure and GCP\n- Security systems (?)\n- Communication systems - Slack, Teams, email, etc.\n- Unstructured data sources - Google drive, Slack/Teams, email, OneDrive\nWe assume that our product will be a SaaS and not a desktop app. We also assume that our product will be accessible via the browser, mobile web and API.\n### Overarching Guideline\nThink modularly, shy away from one-off features, try to bucket functionally-related features into components, make components modular with well-defined interfaces (take inspiration from OO programming), plan for component testability and monitoring, think long-term but build scrappily, feature-by-feature based on demand.\nTo determine whether it’s worth modularizing existing code, use the max(2 hours, 10% of total effort) function as the guiding threshold. If it would add more than the larger of 2 hours and 10% to your project timeline to implement a feature as part of an existing component or to componentize it, it’s probably best to just implement it as a 1-off for now. Things like added maintainability can raise that threshold, while things like security or reliability risks can lower it. Use your judgment and, if in doubt, run it by leadership.\n### Architecture\nThe main components of Zenlytic’s backend are …\nBasic infra:\n• Application database: postgres, RDS\n• K/V store: Redis, AWS-managed\n• Authz/authn: Custom JWT validation\n• Identity management & integrations: Cognito\n• File storage: S3\n• Web server: Gunicorn hosted on ECS (behind LB)\n• Web framework (existing): Flask\n• Web framework (moving to): FastAPI\n• Distributed tasks: Celery hosted on ECS\n• Scheduled tasks: AWS EventBridge (hits public endpoint to trigger celery tasks)\nAgent capabilities:\n• Code interpreter: Azure\n• Plotting: Vegalite\nChat:\n• Streaming: SSE\n• File uploads/parsing:\nDashboards:\nExplores:\nNotifications:\n• Slack integration\n• Teams integration\n• Email\n• Real-time in-app: Websockets (only for “data model has changed, refresh?” notif)\nWorkflows:\nMetrics layer:\n• Separate project\nLarge components that span too many domains:\n• ProjectManager: God class that wraps metrics layer and manages state of a workspace",

This data analyst would have access to all of the internal enterprise data that the business user has access to; it could make sense of the data, answer questions about the data, and create visuals, documents, and presentations for the user. It would go beyond just reporting about internal data to creating predictions and recommendations. Further, the analyst would be capable of deep analysis and could derive root causes of events and recommend preventive actions. In short, it would be an aide capable of performing at the highest levels of intelligence.\nThe purpose of this document is to outline the technical vision for the agentic system,  in support of  Zenlytic’s product vision.\n### Assumptions\n- LLMs will massively improve over time and get significantly better at\n- LLM response quality improves with context quality\n# II. Overarching Guideline\nWe aspire to achieve greater than human-level accuracy and maximum speed in fulfilling user requests. To achieve such accuracy, our starting assumption is that mimicking the process by which human intelligence answers questions will be fast and accurate. Such a process is roughly a breadth-first check with a ranked result and then depth-first by ranking in which each tool used by an LLM to answer the query is responsible for giving back the best response (tool behavior is similar). We may find that there are more optimal processes given that LLMs may not be as computationally constrained as humans. Over time, the differentiating value we bring will come from recognizing deep patterns in data. Since LLMs will get better and better at recognizing patterns in the corpus they are trained on, our differentiation will come from extending that recognition to the private data of each of our customers. The thinking is that we will build up a deep model or network that sits between the customer data and LLMs.\n## Our value propositions\n- Explainability\n- Consistency\n# III. Current Agent Architecture\nAt the core of the Zenlytic agent is an iterative loop. What this means is that when a user makes a request to Zenlytic, internally, we may spend time researching and comprehending the data from the database to answer the user’s request before sending back a response to the user. Conceptually, this back and forth can be thought of as an iteration of the initial request, within the initial request.\nIn the main (outermost) iteration, the user request is sent to the LLM with the full system prompt. The system prompt contains details about the tools available to the LLM to help fulfill the user’s request. The LLM responds with instructions for the agent on which tools to use and what parameters to call the tool with. The results of the tool call are sent back to the LLM. The LLM can respond to the agent with more tool calls, or it can conclude that the user’s request has been fulfilled satisfactorily.\nIn the case of a single loop, therefore, a user message to the agent results in an initial request to the LLM, a response from the LLM with instructions about making a tool call, results from the tool call sent back to the LLM, and a final response from the LLM which is forwarded to the user.\nIn more complex cases, a single user message may result in multiple back-and-forths between the agent and the LLM before the final response to the user. For example, the user request, “sales by month,” results in 2 iterations (main iteration, search iteration) as depicted in the following diagram:\nMore complex queries, or incorrect responses from the LLM, such as hallucinated column names for the data tool, for example, can result in multiple back-and-forths between the system and the LLM before the final response to the user. The data tool, for example, may respond back to the LLM, which may send a modified request, etc.\nWhile the above diagram is a flow diagram, the corresponding system components can be visualized below.\nThis visualization introduces the concept of a master agent and sub-agents, which, for all intents and purposes, are just tools. This is a very simple diagram of a multi-agent system - it is really just a single agent with tools called sub-agents.\n# IV. New Agent Architecture\n## Agent Architecture Phase 1 (2025 Q2)\n### Introducing Context\nTo make Zoë more than just a conversational agent, Zoë needs access to high quality context similar to how a human data analyst needs. Context is defined to be information gathered either implicitly or explicitly from user’s interaction with Zenlytic in general. \nThis combined with the assumption that LLM providers will continue to roll-out LLMs with larger context-window and better instruction following, we need to have the infrastructure in place to provide high quality context to the LLM to improve our user’s experience.\nContext Dimensions\n- Workspace-level context\n- User-level context\n- Conversation context\nTechnical implementation detail:\n### Creating Specialized Agents\nTo realize the value of a multi-agent system, however, the concept of sub-agent has to be further developed. Sub-agents can't be simple tools, but should share a common interface with the rest of our software components. They can be agents in their own right. Expanding this concept leads to the diagram below. It is similar to the basic multi-agent diagram except that it distinguishes between tools and sub-agents. In this system, tools refer to deterministic code, such as a search query against an index or a SQL query against a datastore. Sub-agents, on the other hand, are agents that may have multiple tools and multiple sub-agents nested within them. \n<TODO: Insert deterministic workflows and conversation> \n<TODO: Only a subset of tools should be available at a given point. Higher control over tool call sequences>\nThis system introduces a “Response Processor,” with a link back to the component of the agent that makes the decision about which tool or subagent to call. This idea needs to be fleshed out more. The central concept is whether there is a model outside the LLM that decides what tool or subagent to route LLM responses to and whether this model is tuned using backprop.\nRegardless, the concept of sub-agents is just one of modularization and parallelization. A tool implemented as a sub-agent can be developed and improved in isolation from the master agent. The prompt from a sub-agent to the LLM can have a smaller, more precise context, allowing the LLM to respond with a more accurate response than had it been given a larger context. Sub-agents can be tuned to use multiple tools in sequence or in parallel and blend the results before sending them back to the LLM.\nThis architecture also provides a framework for developing higher-level or complementary agents, such as agents for modeling,  forecasting, or deep research.\n### Query Agent Implementation\n### Enabling faster iteration\n## Agent Architecture Phase 2\n### Improve with usage\nFrom top to bottom, our structure should be able to improve with more usage\nLearning to invoke the right agents\nLearning to invoke the right tools\n• tools success rate (still testing)\nThe “Response Processor” in the V1 architecture optimizes the use of the different tools and subagents. It doesn’t address the LLM. As a different avenue of optimization, we can explore using different LLMs. We could fine-tune a model and use that. By putting everything together, we would have multiple possible LLMs, tools, and subagents from which to choose. Maybe there’s a play for Reinforcement Learning here as well.\nWe can implement tools that don’t query a SQL relational database, such as some time-series databases.\n## Agent Architecture Phase 3\nEvolve agents from seed questions\nParallel agents \n• Knowledge graph (might be in the context of a few specific tools)",

      "content": "As part of the new agent structure, we will be leveraging core components of Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) to increase: \n• flexibility\n• adaptability\n• replay-ability\n# Strengths of EDA\nStrengths of EDA that we want to bring to our core agent logic\n• each event represents a unit of “fact”\n• events are stored in event brokers (not to be confused with message brokers)\n• the event broker is an append-only log\n• events are produced by a producer and consumed by multiple consumers. Consumers do not need to know the existence of other consumers. \n• EventRecords can be created either through application code or converting an existing table. (table-stream duality)\n## A quick re-visit of the different types of events\nUn-keyed Event\nRepresents a single statement of fact\n• Examples\nEntity Keyed Event\nRepresents a single statement of fact keyed on a unique entity ID with the purpose of constructing an entity.\n• Examples\nKeyed Event\nRepresents a single statement of fact keyed on a unique ID but is not tied to an entity used to reconstruct a state\n• Examples\n# How do these strengths apply to the agent structure?\nIn our application, most events will be Keyed Events with the following purposes:\n• serve as instructions that agents pass around to each other\n• serve as instructions within an agent for multi-turn thinking process\n• serve as the basis to project into a context state that is used by agents\n## Events as inter-agent instructions\nThink of instructions as an edge in a directional graph, with each node representing the agent to invoke. \n<add diagram here>\n## Events as thinking steps\n<TODO>\n## Events as basis\nTo form a “state”, whether it is a JSON object or a table, all we need to do is to replay a subset of EntityRecords, in order. \nThe projected “state” is the source-of-truth for the bounded context.\nAs long as we capture each EventRecord at a fine-grained level so that the collection of EventRecords spans the full space we care about (their field matrix has full rank), we can express any desired state as a linear combination of those events.\n## Our Implementation\n• we’re relying on existing Postgres infrastructure to imitate an event broker\n• A table does not natively support “append-only log” so we rely on application code to prevent modifying or deleting existing rows.\n# What are the real features in our application?\n## Agents leveraging memory\n<TODO>\nOn a workspace level, user level, conversation level and agent level\n# What do we gain from this structure?\n## Flexibility\n• The producer of EventRecords does not need to know how other consumer services are going to use it. Consumer services only need to maintain the projected state within its own boundary context. \n• In a CRUD based architecture, we would need to know the entry location for creating a new entity. \n## Replay-ability\nThere are two types of replays. \nReplaying user messages on new code\nThis is useful when we want to verify quality change in production data before officially rolling it out to users. Code-change examples that will affect quality\n• add new LLM provider (ex: Gemini) or version (Claude-4)\n• tweak a system prompt and make sure the problem is fixed without degrading other\n• update tool implementation\nReplaying old user-assistant messages from root up to a cut-off point\nHaving replay-ability means we get out-of-the-box solution for features:\n• Message threading\n• Edit message in the middle of a conversation\n• A/B testing\n## Adaptability\nAdapt to fast roll-outs of new LLM API functionalities\nBeing able to adapt to the speed the LLM providers are updating their API is crucial for us and we cannot rely on a single canonical format to send requests to these APIs. In fact, we have observed discrepancies or nuances of each LLM and added ad-hoc fixes.\n• Claude doesn’t allow ending a conversation with a tool message\n• Gemini doesn’t support recursive tool schema\n• OpenAI releases a new response API that doesn’t conform to the old Completion API\nIt’s true that there are services or libraries like LiteLLM that takes in a canonical format and then run the transformation before requesting the native APIs. And it did allow us to move fast and rollout new models when we have a single agent.\nHowever, if we rely on a 3rd party service/library like LiteLLM, we will always be restricted by the speed at which they release the transformations.\nBest case, we add a bunch of if statements and ad-hoc logic.\nWorst case, we miss out on new functionality rollouts such as:\n• Claude offering prompt caching\n• OpenAI offers fine-tuning\n• OpenAI has reasoning efforts while Gemini offers a “thinking budget” parameter\nA longer discussion.<TODO: Add link here>\nWith events, we can start emitting new events in a new schema with a new transformation layer (adaptor). And only consumers who need this new version call on the new adaptor. Any consumers that doesn’t need the new feature will continue to call the V1 adaptor. \nThis means we can quickly experiment a new LLM provider feature without worrying how it would affect the rest of the application.\nIn a CRUD-based structure, every time a provider adds a new feature, we must alter the message table to add columns (or expand a JSON column). For any non-nullable field, we need a backfill strategy or default values. The biggest issue is that we have to check all downstream implications. \nNote: It is still very possible to solve this issue by adding a version column to the table. In fact, because we currently rely on a Postgres table as an event persistent storage, this is exactly how it’s implemented right now. See [We don’t have a schema registry] section for more discussion.\nMake constructing context simpler to iterate\n<TODO: Add examples here>\nExample: \nAnother migration option for the projected states\nNormally, when there is an update to a table schema, we would need to perform a table migration. \nIf the schema change is strictly on the projected state, we also have a separate option of just replaying the same subset of EventRecords with a new processing logic. \nNote: A schema change on the EventRecord itself is a separate issue. \n# What are some things that we need to be cautious with this new structure? \n## Strict control over versions\nProducer\n• All event records should have a version and record_type tied to it. \n• The EventRecords should be an append-only list. We’re currently using a Postgres database as a replacement for a true event broker like Kafka. Postgres doesn’t natively block updates and deletes so we need to be careful to stay true to the append-only list. We will lose replay-ability if we somehow update and delete the EventRecords\n• Note: Compaction can be implemented through update and delete, but it’s a different concept from a CRUD-based update/delete. We should only run compaction if it’s strictly necessary.\nConsumers\n• Consumers should always filter for EventRecords with the record_type and version combination that they can handle. \n• All processors should have logic to check if there are supported record_type with a newer version. In this case, log a warning to the system. This means that there are new events that the consumer is not handling. \nThis is similar to when an upstream API provider updates their API version. One could argue that it is actually safer to run this version gate check than to run a full database migration without knowing the implications of downstream effects. Missing results is easier to spot and debug than having wrong results.\n## EventRecords are only for the agent’s logic\nApplication logic that is not part of the agent’s logic does not belong to EventRecords. \nIf we think that an LLM can benefit from an event information such as “user rage clicks on explore tab”, then we can add the event to EventRecords.\n## Our current Postgres implementation is not a real event broker\nWe don’t have a schema registry\nThat means we’re storing a JSON blob in one of the database column. \nMost registry can enforce rules like BACKWARD, FORWARD and FULL that the event broker can validate at ingestion. We could simulate this behavior by validating the payload schema before storing it in the registry. However, this solution would not be as clean as event broker validation because the enforcement lives in code instead on the persistent storage.\n## If we have an immutable log, does that mean that this list can grow indefinitely? \nYes. Theoretically, the EventRecord list could grow indefinitely. A typical way to solve this is through compaction. However, we are currently creating the EventRecords at the message level, the storage complexity that we we’re storing at is about the same as our current message table. O(mn), with m as the number of conversations and n the number of messages within a conversation. ",

      "title": "Zoë Tips & Tricks",
      "parent": "Engineering Wiki",
      "content": "In this document, we’ll cover the top tips and tricks for setting up Zoë, Zenlytic’s AI analyst.\n---\n# Start here\nWhen thinking about how you’re defining your data model for use with Zoë, ask this question. \n> Could a talented data analyst answer questions using this data model on their first day on the job before they have any other context on the business?\nIf the answer to that question is yes, then Zoë will perform great! If not, use some of the tips below to encode more business context, so Zoë knows what metrics to choose in which situations.\n# Voice \nYou can also ask Zoë questions verbally as well as with text. You can do this by clicking on the microphone to start Zoë recording and clicking again to stop her listening. You can also use the keyboard shortcut cmd + i to start and stop Zoë’s recording.\n# Clear Naming\nClearly naming your metrics (measures) and dimensions is key for Zoë to perform well for you. If you have two revenue metrics defined as Revenue first and Revenue second, Zoë, like a human analyst, will have no idea which one to pick. \nHowever, if you define those two values as Gross revenue and Net revenue Zoë will have no problem distinguishing between them and when to use one vs. the other. If an outside analyst could read all your metric definitions and understand which ones to use in the right cases, Zoë would also be able to.\n# Let Zoë know about categorical values\nZoë will never index your data unless you explicitly tell her to. This protects your privacy and makes sure we never index sensitive or regulated data.\nMany times you’ll want to be able to ask questions like “How many orders do we have in fulfillment placed more than a week ago?” But if the fulfillment category is hidden in a field nebulously called status, Zoë won’t know how to find the right filter.\nAdd the searchable property to the status dimension like:\n```\n- name: status\n  field_type: dimension\n  type: string\n  sql: ${TABLE}.status\n  searchable: true\n```\nThis will tell Zoë to index the categories in this dimension (this works up to 10,000 categories, contact support for a use case with >10,000 unique categories).\nNow Zoë will be able to answer the question “How many orders do we have in fulfillment placed more than a week ago?” by applying the right status = 'fulfillment' filter using the capitalization in the database to the query.\n# Associate times with metrics\nEach metric in Zenlytic should be associated with a time dimension group. The associated dimension group with a metric is called that metric’s canon_date. \nThis let’s Zoë apply time periods correctly and trend metrics over time while guaranteeing that we’re using the right time dimension.\nYou can associate a time dimension with a view using the default_date property. \n```\nversion: 1\ntype: view\nname: google_ad_stats\nmodel_name: my_company \nsql_table_name: PROD.GOOGLE_AD_STATS\ndefault_date: ad_stat_recorded_at\n\nfields:\n...\n- name: ad_stat_recorded_at\n  field_type: dimension_group\n  type: time\n  datatype: date\n  timeframes:\n  - raw\n  - date\n  - week\n  - month\n  - quarter\n  - year\n  sql: ${TABLE}.DATE\n...\n```\nUnder the default date property you’ll just reference the name of the time you want to use as the default date. \nThe default date will be the default canon_date for all metrics in that view unless their canon_date is set on the metric explicitly. \nYou can also use a canon_date or default_date that is not in the same table as your metric. To use that date, just make sure it is possible to join that field in, and reference it like default_date: google_record_stats.recorded_at, using the view name before the field name.\nUsing an example from subscription management\n```\nversion: 1\ntype: view\nname: subscriptions\nmodel_name: my_company\nsql_table_name: PROD.SUBSCRIPTIONS\ndefault_date: created_at\n\nfields:\n...\n- name: created_at\n  field_type: dimension_group\n  type: time\n  timeframes:\n  - raw\n  - date\n  - week\n  - month\n  - quarter\n  - year\n  sql: ${TABLE}.CREATED_AT\n\n- name: canceled_at\n  field_type: dimension_group\n  type: time\n  timeframes:\n  - raw\n  - date\n  - week\n  - month\n  - quarter\n  - year\n  sql: ${TABLE}.CANCELED_AT\n\n- name: new_subscriptions\n  field_type: measure\n  type: count_distinct\n\tsql: ${subscription_id}\n  description: \"This is the unique number of subscriptions by the date created\"\n\n- name: canceled_subscriptions\n  field_type: measure\n  type: count_distinct\n\tsql: ${subscription_id}\n  canon_date: canceled_at\n  description: \"This is the unique number of subscriptions by the date canceled\"\n...\n```\nThe first measure inherits the canon_date of created_at from the default_date on the view, and the second one is set explicitly to be canceled_at because its definition needs to use another date to derive its meaning.\n# Use drills to define your entities\nYou can use drills/entities in Zenlytic to let Zoë know about important entities in your data. Entities can be any group of fields that you want, and they can describe anything from products to users to transactions to sales_reps. Let’s look at an example of defining one of those entities for sales_reps:\n```\nversion: 1\ntype: view\nname: sales_reps\nmodel_name: my_company\nsql_table_name: PROD.SALES_REPS\ndefault_date: joined_at\n\nfields:\n...\n- name: sales_rep_id\n  field_type: dimension\n  type: string\n  sql: ${TABLE}.id\n\ttags: ['Sales Rep']\n\tdrill_fields: [first_name, last_name, email, status]\n\n- name: first_name\n  field_type: dimension\n  type: string\n  sql: ${TABLE}.first_name\n\n- name: last_name\n  field_type: dimension\n  type: string\n  sql: ${TABLE}.last_name\n\n- name: email\n  field_type: dimension\n  type: string\n  sql: ${TABLE}.email\n\n- name: status\n  field_type: dimension\n  type: string\n  sql: ${TABLE}.status\n\n- name: joined_at\n  field_type: dimension_group\n  type: time\n  timeframes:\n  - raw\n  - date\n  - week\n  - month\n  - quarter\n  - year\n  sql: ${TABLE}.JOINED_AT\n```\nThis will let Zoë know that you have an entity called a “Sales rep” and that entity should typically include the fields first_name, last_name, email, and status when that entity is referenced.\nThis will also give you a drop down option on all Zenlytic plots for “Drill into sales reps” when it’;s possible to join these fields into your data.\n# Descriptions help steer Zoë’s decisions\nYou can add a description to your metrics (measures) like this\n \n```\n- name: gross_aov\n  field_type: measure\n  type: average\n  sql: ${TABLE}.revenue\n  description: |\n\t\t  This is the gross average order value. This just covers \n      DTC revenue, and is sometimes internally referred \n      to as 'the magic' This is the metric that \n      should be used when someone asks about AOV, generally speaking\n```\nIn the description above, we’re adding a lot of useful context that the model will be able to use to improve its performance. For example, if someone now asks for the “magic” or nebulously asks for AOV without specifying gross or net, Zoë will know which metric to choose based on the description.\nWriting good descriptions will help your end users better understand what they’re looking at and it will boost Zoë performance.\n# Synonyms help Zoë find metrics \nYou can use the synonyms tag to specify keywords for Zoë so she can find the the right field. For example, you might have a LOT of “customers” fields but you want to make sure Zoë always sees the new_vs_repeat field on order lines , even though the name of the view doesn’t have a reference to a customer by name.\nIn this example, we’ve added the synonyms customer and loyalty to the new_vs_repeat field to make sure if Zoë users are asking about “existing customers” or repeat behavior like “loyalty” this field will show up in context for Zoë. \n```\n- name: new_vs_repeat\n  field_type: dimension\n  type: string\n  sql: ${TABLE}.new_vs_repeat\n  description: The new vs repeat status of the purchaser\n  synonyms: \n  - customer\n  - loyalty\n```",

      "parent": "Engineering Wiki",
      "content": "In this document, we’ll cover how to use the extra prompt context feature when setting up Zoë, Zenlytic’s AI analyst.\n---\n# What instructions does Zoë already have?\nWhen adding new context for Zoë, you should try not to repeat or contradict instructions she is given in the Zenlytic-set system prompt. \nThese are the high-level instructions we give Zoë by default when you interact with her:\n• You are Zenlytic's self-serve Business Intelligence (BI) assistant deployed in a chat interface.\n• You operate on the company's semantic layer.\n• You are assisting the company: <your-company-name> and the current date is <current-date>\n• Clarify ambiguous questions with follow-up questions.\nDon't change these instructions when adding additional context for Zoë because doing so will confuse Zoë and hurt her performance.\n# How should I add instructions?\nWhen structuring additional instructions for Zoë, make sure they are clearly written and contain a straightforward action Zoë should follow. \nA good heuristic is: \n> If a human was skimming this, would they still get the point and do what I’m asking?\nGenerally, it’s helpful to emphasize certain points to make sure Zoë follows them. For example, if you’re trying to get Zoë to ask a follow up question for a time period on a large table saying:\n```\nAsk for a time period if not given one.\n```\nWill not work as well as:\n```\nWhen asked a question that does not contain a time period filter, you must ALWAYS ask the user for the time period they want to use to view the data.\n```\nUsing bullet points or wrapping additional logic under a “Guidelines” header is also helpful. A good example is:\n```\nAdditional Guidelines:\n- The acronym FFDC refers to the marketing function at our company. When users ask for that, interpret it as the word marketing.\n- When the user asks a question in a non-English language, you must ALWAYS respond in the same language in which you were asked the question.\n- When the user asks a question without a time period specified, you must ALWAYS ask a follow-up question to make them pick a time period.\n```",

      "title": "Zoë Prompt Engineering Guide",
      "parent": "Engineering Wiki",
      "content": "Prompt engineering is essential for ensuring Zoë understands how to best interpret and interact with your data. Prompt engineering in the general sense is how you ask Zoë to do tasks for you or how you show her context on your business. \n## How you ask Zoë\nHow to Ask Good Questions of Zoë\nBe Specific: Clearly state exactly what you’re looking for. For example:\n• “Why did sales decline last week?” might imply you want insights by product, location, or both. If you have something in mind, don’t make her guess, tell Zoe! Audio helps with this a ton. \nDefine Your Expectations:\n• If you have an expected outcome or perspective, clearly articulate that.\n• If you’re uncertain and want exploratory analysis, let Zoe know, but understand responses will also be exploratory.\nExample Interaction:\n• “Show me daily revenue split out by what I’ve been running on Facebook.”\nFirst response:\n• Zoe might provide daily gross sales data filtered for the Facebook channel.\nIterative Refinement:\n• If the initial response isn’t what you expected, refine your request:\nEmbrace Iteration\n• If Zoe’s response isn’t perfectly aligned with your expectations, refine your instructions.\nTreat the interaction as collaborative rather than a one-off query.\n## How you give Zoë context\nZoë's context can be organized at four distinct levels—system, topic, view/table, and field. Each level gives her context on how to deal with data its associated data.\n### 1. System-Level Context\nThe system prompt is the highest level of context for Zoë. Information placed here is always available to her, directly influencing all interactions and behaviors. Use the system prompt for:\n• Universal parameters (e.g., your organization's fiscal year start date).\n• Broad behavioral instructions (e.g., instructing Zoë to consistently provide concise answers).\nThis context ensures that overarching instructions or critical organizational details remain consistently applied.\nYou can apply changes to the prompt at this level in the Extra Prompt Context window in the Settings → Zoë.\n### 2. Topic-Level Context\nA topic is a group of interconnected tables (e.g., orders, products, customers). Metadata or instructions placed at the topic level should:\n• Apply universally to all tables within the topic.\n• Guide Zoë specifically in scenarios relevant to that topic.\nFor example, financial reporting might require Zoë to use fiscal dates while operational reporting uses calendar dates. Clearly define these rules at the topic level to avoid confusion for Zoë.\nYou can apply these changes in the topic yaml file.\n### 3. View or Table-Level Context\nTable-level context should only contain instructions specific to a particular view or table. \nHowever, it is generally recommended to minimize or avoid using table-level prompts to maintain clarity. Instead, place such information at the topic level, unless there is unique behavior strictly applicable to a single table.\nYou can apply these changes in the view yaml file.\n### 4. Field-Level Context\nField-level context pertains to individual fields within tables or views. Use this level for:\n• Specific field-handling instructions (e.g., \"Always apply filter XYZ when querying this field\").\n• Setting default preferences (e.g., defaulting to \"gross revenue\" over \"net revenue\" when both exist and the user only asks for “revenue”).\nThis precise control ensures Zoë correctly and consistently utilizes specific fields as intended.\nYou can apply these changes in the field entry in the view yaml file.\nBy thoughtfully structuring prompts across these four levels: system, topic, view/table, and field, you give Zoë the context to accurately use your organization's data to answer your questions, and help you make faster and higher impact decisions.",

      "content": "Ex Quanta Inc (d.b.a Zenlytic)\n## Human Resource Security\nVersion: 1.1\nPolicy Owner: Paul Blankley\nStatus: Implemented\n## Testing Minutes\n### 1. Purpose and Scope\nThe purpose of this Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is to ensure that our Business Intelligence (BI) platform can continue to operate during and after a disruptive event. This plan outlines the steps for preparedness, response, and recovery, ensuring minimal disruption to critical BI services such as data processing, reporting, and analytics. It applies to all systems, personnel, and processes supporting the platform.\n### 2. Objectives\n• Maintain availability of critical BI services with minimal downtime.\n• Protect sensitive data and ensure data integrity.\n• Provide clear roles, responsibilities, and actions for team members in the event of a disruption.\n• Ensure a swift recovery of services to meet Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO).\n### 3. Risk Assessment and Business Impact Analysis (BIA)\nA detailed risk assessment and BIA have been conducted to identify potential risks and their impacts on the BI platform. Key risks include, but are not limited to:\n• Software issues or bugs\n• Vendor failures\n• Network outages\n• Cybersecurity attacks (DDoS, etc.)\nRisks are fully outlined in the CC1.2.2 Risk Assessment document.\nImpact on Business Operations: Downtime of the BI platform could result in lost business insights, reduced operational efficiency, and missed business opportunities.\n### 4. Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)\n• Recovery Time Objectives (RTO): The BI platform must be restored within 4 hours of a disruption for critical services.\n• Recovery Point Objectives (RPO): Data loss must not exceed 15 minutes in the event of a disruption.\n### 5. Key Components of the BI Platform\n• Cloud infrastructure: Hosted primarily on Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n• Data storage: All data is backed up using native AWS RDS features. This policy is documented in our CC7.2.2 Database Backup Policy \n### 6. Business Continuity Strategies\n6.1 High Availability and Redundancy\n• Database Failover: RDS instances for databases have multi-AZ replication enabled to automatically failover in the event of failure.\n• Auto-scaling: AWS ECS is configured for auto-scaling, ensuring that enough resources are available during peak loads or disruptions.\n6.2 Backup and Recovery\n• Data Backups: Automated backups are taken of all critical data using AWS RDS, with replication to multiple AWS regions. Backup frequency is every 5 minutes to meet the RPO\n6.3 Incident Response Plan\n• Incident Detection: 24/7 monitoring through AWS CloudWatch and GuardDuty. Alerts are configured for anomalies such as unusual traffic, latency, or failed services.\n• Incident Escalation: Incidents are escalated based on severity. \n• Response Procedures: In the event of a disruption:\n### 7. Communication Plan\nIn the event of a disruption, the following communication steps will be followed:\n• Internal Communication: Incident response team is immediately notified via Slack and email. Regular updates on the status of the disruption and recovery process will be provided.\n• Customer Communication: In case of significant outages that invoke the BCP (exceeding 4 hours or lost customer data), affected customers will be notified via email within 24 hours of the event, with updates provided as available.\n### 8. Testing and Maintenance\n• Testing Schedule: The Business Continuity Plan will be tested annually to ensure that all procedures are up-to-date and effective. Testing will include failover simulations, backup restoration, and incident response drills.\n• Plan Review: The BCP will be reviewed quarterly, or after a significant incident, to incorporate lessons learned, changes in infrastructure, or updates in business operations.\n• Training: All relevant personnel will undergo BCP training annually, covering roles, responsibilities, and response procedures.\n### 9. Roles and Responsibilities\n• Incident Commander: Coordinates the overall incident response, communication, and recovery efforts.\n• DevOps Team: Responsible for infrastructure restoration, failover, and ensuring system availability.\n• Database Administrators: Restore database services and ensure data integrity post-recovery.\n• Communications Lead: Responsible for internal and external communication during an incident.\n### 10. Continuous Improvement\nAfter each incident or disruption, a post-incident review will be conducted to:\n• Analyze the root cause of the disruption.\n• Evaluate the effectiveness of the BCP response.\n• Identify areas for improvement and update the BCP accordingly.\n## 11. Compliance\nAll staff are required to comply with this Business Continuity Plan. Non-compliance may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.",
